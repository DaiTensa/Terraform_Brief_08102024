# Mission

In this mission, we will learn how to use Terraform to automate the deployment of infrastructure on Azure. we will discover how to:

- Create a virtual machine (VM) for testing or data processing jobs.
- Configure a storage account and a Blob Container to organize and store files flexibly.
- Deploy a Web App that can be used to expose results or web services.

This exercise will allow us to master the fundamentals of cloud provisioning, which is essential for future projects in Data Engineering.
